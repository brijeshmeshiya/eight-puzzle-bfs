================

The 8 puzzle consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is always empty thus making 
it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell.

I've used Breadth First Search Algorithm to solve this puzzle . It will lead to Optimal Solution if Solution Exists.
